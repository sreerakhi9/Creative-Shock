# Creative-Shock
Creative Shock is a global social business case competition for students which first took place in 2011. Participants every year are gathered to solve finance, marketing, PR and strategy problems for social businesses. By organizing this competition, we seek to introduce students to real-life global social business models and to communicate how all traditional business strategies can be applied to social enterprises and organizations, improve studentsâ€™ strategic thinking by challenging them with real marketing and management problems, promote social business all around the world.  Participants have to solve two social business cases in the preliminary rounds. The best 10 teams gather in Vilnius, Lithuania to solve the two final cases.
